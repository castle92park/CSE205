1. Pursue high quality in every aspect of the work. - 2.1
- Though it may not be possible to achieve the ultimately idealistic value in 
every work, as a professional one must always commit to the best possible design
throughout the process of work. For example, while designing a code for an 
inventory application in java, one should consider the reusability of the code 
and use reasonable number of different classes, rather than cramming all 
functionality in one single class.

2. Be open to criticism and opinions.   - 2.4
- The quality of programming work can be greatly influenced and improved by the
review of peer professionals. Even though collaboration on assignments in CSE205
is strictly prohibited, students can improve their code by reviewing each 
other's codes and exchanging varying perspectives and approaches to a shared
objective.

3. Understand your capabilities and contribute to a field of such. - 2.6
- A programmer should be aware of their scope of expertise and make ethical 
judgement when accepting a computing assignment. If a Java programmer is 
assigned a work that entails coding in a language one is unfamiliar with, the
programmer should clearly notify the employer of one's incompetence.

4. Computing work must prioritize the common benefit. - 3.1
- Central or peripheral, a group that is involved with the work should be the 
main concern in the process and result of a programming work. In other words, 
a programmer's personal interest or private relation shall not disrupt the 
common good that may be affected by the programming work.

5. Consider compatibility of a software system. - 3.6
- A simplest change made to an existing source code can drastically change its
utility and impact. A programmer must take into consideration the legacy 
compatibility as well as the ramification of the addition/modification when 
writing codes. When Apple retired Aperture, an image editing and organization 
application, they provided adequate support for users to migrate to different 
systems such as their new Photos app or Adobe Lightroom.
